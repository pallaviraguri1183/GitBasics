 ## Model :
    - model is a class
    - this class will represent db table or collection in data base

    - To convert a model class to db table , we have to run a command in cmd prompt
            ``` python manage.py makemigrations ```
        -> after running this makemigrations command , it will create a interface file
        -> By using this interface file we have to create a db table
        -> for that we have to run a command
            ''' python manage.py migrate
        -> after running this command it will generate db table with name of 'appname_modelclass'
