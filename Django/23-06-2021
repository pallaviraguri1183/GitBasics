ORM(object relational mapping);
  - In django we are usig ORM to perform CRUD operation
  - To practice ORM queries we have to open django shell by using 
       ``` python manage.py shell ```
  - we have to make a connection between shell prompt and models.py
       ``` from FirstApp.models import Register ```
  - now we have to insert a record
  - SQL query (for insertion record) is:
       ``` insert into register values("pandu","pandu11183@gmail.com") ```

  - ORM Query :
        reg = Register(name = "ashu", email = "ashu@gmail.com")
        reg.save()
                  (or)
        reg1 = Register.objects.create()
  - retrive records:
        - retrive all records:
        - SQL Query:
             ``` select * from register ```
        - ORM query:
             ``` data = Register.objects.all() ```
        - retrive a special column i.e, email
        - SQL Query:
             ``` select email from register ```
        - ORM Query:
             ``` data = Register.objects.all() ```
             - Iterate loop like this
                ``` for row in data:
                         print(row.email)
                ```
        - retrive a specific row:
        - SQL Query:
             ``` select * from register where name = pandu ```
        - ORM Query:
           - to retrie a specific row, here we have two defferent methods 
               1. by using filter()
                   ``` info = Register.objects.filter(name="pandu") ```
               2. by using get()
                - get() dont accept multiple records
                   ``` info = Register.objects.get(name="pandu") ```
            - i want to retrive a record whose name is pandu and whose mail id is pandu@gmail.com
                - SQL Query is:
                   ``` select * from register where name = 'pandu' and email='panndu@gmail.com' ```
                - ORM Query:
                   ``` info = Register.objects.filter(name="pandu",email="pandu@gmail.com") ```
            - to retrive first record
                ```  info = Register.objects.all().first() ```   
            - to retrive last record
                ```  info = Register.objects.all().last() ```
            - to retrivr fiest two records
                ```  info = Register.objects.all().[:2] ```

        # Update a record:
          - To update a specific record:
            - SQL Query:
                ``` update Register set email = 'vyshu123@gmail.com' where name = vyshu ```
            - ORM :
                ``` info = Register.objects.get(name="vyshu")
                    info.email = vyshu123@gmail.com
                    info.save()
                ```
        # Delete a record :
            - SQL Query :
                ``` delete from register where name ="bhagi" ```
            - ORM :
                ``` info = Register.objects.get(name='bhagi')
                    info.delete() 
                ```
        - To remove all records:
            - SQL Query:
                ``` delete from register ```
            - ORM Query :
                ``` Register.objects.all.delete() ```
